    <section id="what-is-protein">
        <h2>What is Protein?</h2>
        <p>Protein is an essential macronutrient that plays a critical role in building and repairing tissues in the
            body. It is composed of amino acids, which are the building blocks of life. Proteins are involved in
            numerous bodily functions including enzyme production, immune response, and muscle contraction.</p>

        <h3>Amino Acids</h3>
        <p>Amino acids are classified into two types: essential and non-essential. The body cannot produce essential
            amino acids, so they must be obtained through food. Non-essential amino acids can be synthesized by the
            body.</p>

        <h3>Complete vs Incomplete Proteins</h3>
        <p>Complete proteins contain all nine essential amino acids in sufficient quantities, while incomplete proteins
            lack one or more of these amino acids. Animal-based foods like meat, fish, and dairy products are considered
            complete proteins, while plant-based foods like beans, grains, and vegetables are usually incomplete, though
            some plant-based sources, like quinoa and soy, are complete proteins.</p>

    <section id="sources">
        <h2>Protein Sources</h2>
        <h3>Animal-Based Sources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> High-quality protein with all essential amino acids.</li>
            <li><strong>Chicken:</strong> A lean source of protein that is low in fat.</li>
            <li><strong>Fish:</strong> Salmon, tuna, and other fish are rich in protein and omega-3 fatty acids.</li>
            <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Provides a high amount of protein, iron, and zinc.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Plant-Based Sources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Legumes:</strong> Beans, lentils, and peas are rich in protein and fiber.</li>
            <li><strong>Nuts and Seeds:</strong> Almonds, chia seeds, and hemp seeds provide protein, healthy fats, and
                fiber.</li>
            <li><strong>Tofu and Tempeh:</strong> Soy-based products that are complete protein sources.</li>
            <li><strong>Whole Grains:</strong> Foods like quinoa, farro, and barley provide protein and complex carbs.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Dairy Sources</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Milk:</strong> A great source of high-quality protein and calcium.</li>
            <li><strong>Yogurt:</strong> Provides protein and beneficial probiotics.</li>
            <li><strong>Cottage Cheese:</strong> A high-protein dairy product with low fat.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="benefits">
        <h2>Benefits of Protein</h2>
        <h3>Muscle Growth</h3>
        <p>Protein is crucial for building and repairing muscle tissues. After exercise, consuming protein helps muscles
            recover and grow stronger.</p>

        <h3>Immune Function</h3>
        <p>Proteins like antibodies are essential for the immune system, helping the body fight off infections and
            illnesses.</p>

        <h3>Skin, Hair, and Nails</h3>
        <p>Keratin, a protein, is vital for healthy skin, hair, and nails. Adequate protein intake promotes growth and
            repair of these tissues.</p>

        <h3>Weight Management</h3>
        <p>Protein helps increase satiety, reducing overall calorie intake and promoting fat loss while preserving
            muscle mass.</p>

        <h3>Enzyme Production</h3>
        <p>Proteins are the building blocks of enzymes, which are responsible for speeding up chemical reactions in the
            body, aiding digestion, and other vital functions.</p>

    <section id="protein-deficiency">
        <h2>Protein Deficiency</h2>
        <p>A lack of protein in the diet can lead to muscle wasting, weakened immune function, and slower recovery from
            injury. Symptoms of protein deficiency include fatigue, hair loss, and difficulty in healing wounds.</p>
        <p>People who follow restrictive diets, like vegans or those with certain medical conditions, are more at risk
            for protein deficiency.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="protein-supplements">
        <h2>Protein Supplements</h2>
        <p>Protein supplements can be helpful for those who have higher protein needs or who struggle to meet their
            protein intake through food alone. Common protein supplements include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Whey Protein:</strong> A fast-digesting protein derived from milk, commonly used post-workout.
            </li>
            <li><strong>Casein Protein:</strong> A slow-digesting milk protein, often consumed before bed to support
                muscle recovery overnight.</li>
            <li><strong>Plant-Based Proteins:</strong> Powders made from peas, hemp, and soy, suitable for vegans and
                vegetarians.</li>
            <li><strong>Collagen Protein:</strong> A protein that supports joint and skin health, derived from animal
                connective tissues.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While supplements can be convenient, it is generally better to meet your protein needs through whole food
            sources for better overall nutrition.</p>
